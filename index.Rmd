# Prerequisites {-}

This is a _sample_ harmonization book written in **Markdown**.

The **harmor** package can populate this book with data dictionnary information extracted from a [Opal](https://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/) server. To install **harmor** package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("maelstrom-research/harmor", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The book is then to be assembled with **bookdown**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
```
